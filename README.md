# A simple, responsive, slider
Simple slider that I use for most of my projects. Using almost only CSS (transitions, transform and such) it's super easy to setup and very lightweight.

However, it's currently depending on jQuery.

Feel free to use it in your projects; do whatever you want.

# Bugs?
Please submit an issue, or should you have the solution; make a pull request please.

# More features
I do not plan to implement options, other transitions (only those supported by native CSS) or similar. It's supposed to simply work, with no bs that makes sites lag.

# Events
There is currently no events (e.g. onSlide or such) and there is no plan to implement so.

# Methods
There is currently no methods (e.g. to add new slides at runtime) and there is no plan to implement so.
